# QE_to_SKEAF_for_dHvA
#This code prepares BXSF files for each band compatible as input to the SKEAF program from the Quantum Espresso produced BXSF file from fs.x module.
#This is code for converting the bxsf file generated by Quantum Espresso to the format suitable for SKEAF(A code to simulate dHvA frequency)
#This program writes Fermi energy and band energy in the Rydberg unit in bxsf file. QE produces bxsf file in eV units.
#this code is written by Navneet Kumar Karn at CSIR-NPL
