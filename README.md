# QE_to_SKEAF_for_dHvA
#This code prepares BXSF files for each band compatible as input to the SKEAF program from the Quantum Espresso produced BXSF file from fs.x module.

#This is code for converting the BXSF file generated by Quantum Espresso to the format suitable for SKEAF(A code to simulate dHvA frequency)

#This program writes Fermi energy and band energy in the Rydberg unit in a BXSF file. QE produces BXSF files in eV units.

#this code is written by Navneet Kumar Karn at CSIR-NPL

Cu_fs.bxsf file is a QE-generated input file for the Copper FCC lattice calculated with the PBESol-norm-conserving-full relativistic potential. The file named qe_skeaf_converter_bxsf.py is the main code.

To run, you must have Python3 as the code is written in python3. Keep the input file and Python executable file in the same directory. Open the directory in Terminal and type

$python qe_skeaf_converter_bxsf.py

You will get BXSF file in Rydberg units.

Open these files one by one in Xcrysden and save them in BSXF format in separate files. Now, these files can be used as input file for SKEAF code.
